      Why UI design?: User-Interface design is among the most important aspects of
      comtemporary computer science. As smartphones gain popularity all over the
      world, people pay more and more attention to how an app looks rather than
      purely looking at its performance. First impression is always important. If
      a product is to be successful, it must at first have a nice, friendly user
      interface.

        Dali lab has made a lot of amazing products for Dartmouth students (also
        for non-Dartmouth users). The Dartmouth student App is the most useful app
        that I have ever used in Dartmouth. Furthermore, Pulse is an excellent platform
        on which different populations can be represented in a single survey. I
        really hope to join the Dali team to take part in the development process
        myself. On the other hand, Dali lab is the idea place for me to touch upon
        real projects outside of courseworks. I believe that projects are an
        excellent way of honing programming skills and a good preparation for
        problem-solving.
